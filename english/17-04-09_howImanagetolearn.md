How to change your life for the better - or how I taught myself programming from zero to work in six months

A few posts ago, I already <a href="http://igor-dlinni.livejournal.com/152123.html" target="_blank"> wrote about the motivation </a> and changes in life, but now I would like to highlight more fully This question. In the process of self-study, I had a kind of technique that finally showed its effectiveness in achieving the goal - literally last week I <a href = "http://igor-dlinni.livejournal.com/154313.html" target = "_ blank" > Took to work </a> - so now its effectiveness is confirmed by reality. Immediately make a reservation that I will consider self-learning in the context of programming, but you can easily replace the word "programming" with "design" or "cooking custard" - the meaning of the message does not change from this. I am sure that the method can be applied in any field of human knowledge.
So, a little about yourself and the initial conditions. I was born in Kolpino (a troubled suburb of St. Petersburg), in a working family, studied at the gymnasium, was interested in English since childhood, entered the university LETI, successfully dropped him in the second year, after traveling. I traveled for many years, this is described in some detail in this LJ (see the calendar since 2006), at some point tried to study at the Faculty of Geography of SPbSU, successfully threw it, at some point stuck in Thailand for 4 seasons .

Almost three years ago he returned to Russia. In general, I conducted a fairly free and dissolved way of life (I do not regret a second). Money I earned in many ways - seasonal work on restoration, a guide and a photographer in Thailand, some time even was a yogatcher (which causes infinite perplexity now), then he became a professional stucco. But, at some point, my quality of life began to deteriorate. In part, this is due to the crisis (for the work at the construction site they stopped paying adequately), in part, with increasing my needs (my daughter has a daughter growing up). Now money, which was not so much, was not at all. And not only money - there was no free time, optimism, energy, and the prospects in life and did not smell. By spring - summer of 2016, I turned into an embittered, complaining about life and eternally yearning for a man. Apparently, the crisis of middle age, or just stupidity led to this tipping point. I came to a state where it's already impossible to move on without changes, relying only on the usual actions. So the choice was not great: either feel sorry for yourself and watch your life roll into a ditch, or, like a frog in sour cream, fight!

Complicated the situation is that I like a real hippie I like to think about the action, but do not act - it's like it's easier and more pleasant to dream. So I decided to develop a scientific (advanced) technique - a plan I want to or not, but I will follow. In the process of self-learning, the methodology developed and supplemented, and now, finally, I can try to express it in writing.

In fact, everything is very simple. One side. Actions are simple and understandable. On the other hand, everything is very difficult, therefore life is an indirect product of our personality, and to change our life, we have to change ourselves and do it sincerely - and it will not be done without pain.

So, conventionally the procedure can be divided into 3 stages or sections. The first is a psychological attitude, without it, even if you start, you will quit quickly. The second is the approach to learning (this is the simplest one). The third begins when the foundation of the first and second stage is laid - this is a hunt for opportunities.
<B>
So, let's start with the first one. </ B> The first stage is the most difficult, and although it takes a little action, it should start and go in parallel with everything else. In no case can not ignore the psychological mood - without it nothing happens! The most important thing that you need to do is understand why you need this change. It is very important to focus at this moment on yourself. Healthy selfishness in this stage is what you need. What will give this change to your life? Why do you need it (not for Uncle Vasya, parents, children or the president) - for you? This is very important to understand - and to shift attention from others to yourself, so that later, when it will be difficult and laziness, you could return to this thought - "it's the same for me, so I need to apply the effort too!". The transfer of the goal to yourself is caused by the fact that you stop hoping and expecting something from life. The right moment, Santa Claus, justice, interference of Lord Gd, etc. There is nothing of this - between you now and the changes, then the path is laid only by your own efforts, and you make them for yourself. Here I do not mean a purely selfish approach, when you do not pay attention to anything and start walking on your heads - no. For example, I was helped by the realization that I have a daughter, and I have to raise her, and she needs help. In order for me to do this, I need to be different: to work on another job, to have more free time ... I need to have money and free time for it, but it is important to understand - it is necessary for me. Understanding the causes of actions is a super important point, it's good to use all of us in life. To think not only about what is here, it is necessary to do something, but also about why we need it. Another important point - you need to focus on the short term - this is easier to focus on. It is better to "go to summer to Europe" than "to fly to Mars". Imagine that you are climbing mountains, and on the slope there is one peak that can be seen. Having risen on it, you will see another, but not before. The transfer of goal-setting to yourself is an important point, and it should be treated regularly. Starting from yourself you can make your own efforts and let them be at first minimal, they will come from you, and this is very valuable. I'm doing this because I want to be better, and be able to do this and that. This action has a reason, it is inside of me and I do this action too. From this moment it is possible to smoothly go into the field of motivation - I already spread <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQg_Q4HYYpg "Target =" _ blank "> video from Mattias from FunFunFunction </a>, where he talks about this moment. Even if you watched it, look again. He says very, very important things. The most important thing I learned from him is that the motivation to do something must be internal and not depend on the outside. Otherwise, such an artificial, external motivation will quickly be blown away. You need to rely only on yourself, gentlemen and ladies. As well as be your own authority. Here I can again advise you to read <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BC,_%D0% AD% D1% 80% D0% B8% D1% 85 "Erich Fromm - Escape from Freedom </a>. Read if you have not read it, and if you have read it, read it again. And it will be very much in the topic to read <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%BB,_ % D0% 92% D0% B8% D0% BA% D1% 82% D0% BE% D1% 80 "target =" _ blank "> Victor Frankl </a> - he helped me a lot to deal with depression. But let's not get distracted. Summarizing the question with motivation and psychological mood: shift the focus of attention to yourself, understand why you need it, understand that the secret of success is only in one's own actions. On the day when it becomes sad - get distracted, take a walk, remember why you are doing this, and most importantly - know that everything depends on you! Also, you have to believe in yourself - not having this faith, it will not work. But, I hope, the reader of this article is free from teenage complexes and prejudices, and even if not - the methodology, if he will follow it, will help him. From here we can smoothly go to <b> the second stage </ b> - actually the actions, Job. Each step in action will bring you closer to the cherished goal and support you in believing in yourself. Comparing your work a month ago, and now, you will see positive changes. Actions are very interesting. What is needed for effective action: I can distinguish two large sections: the first is regularity, the second is action "wisely". Let's start in order. If you read the modern theories of neuroplasticity (I can recommend the book We Are Our Brain - then it will be obvious to you - to fix the skill you need to apply it regularly. All our skills and knowledge depend on the structure of the brain. There is a certain spread of predisposition, of course there is, but with proper training and proper approach, the brain can be very seriously reconstructed (for example, I was once very impressed with <a href = "http://newizv.ru/news/society/12-10 -2009 / 115782-zhonglirovanie-uvelichivaet-beloe-veshestvo-mozga-vyvod-uchenyh.html? Format = html & amp; slug_for_redirect = lenta% 2F2009-10-12% 2F115782-zhonglirovanie-uvelichivaet-beloe-veshestvo-mozga-vyvod-uchenyh "Target =" _ blank "> a study of the brain size of jugglers </a>. It increases noticeably in volume with prolonged training), but it happens on a physical level - if quite simply, understanding is the ability of several Areas of the brain to act together. So that they can act together, they need a connection - neurons need to physically germinate into each other with their axons, so that the current of thoughts can flow continuously. This relationship is established only in the case when you are trying to do this action, which you are training, and do it regularly - then the body will gradually understand that You need a stronger connection and begin to sprout neurons into each other. So the habit is formed. We, in fact, use habits constantly, we simply do not know how to turn them for good. And here your actions (in my case it was writing programs), it is necessary to turn into a habit. Habit, this is something that you do regularly, then you need to regularly write code (or draw, or play the guitar, etc.). In the beginning, while the neural connections are still weak, it will be hard, but then you will already feel uncomfortable if today you have not done your already familiar action. It is very good to use some kind of marker of what you did today. Programmers are comfortable, they have a githab - this is such a large code repository. When you load the code there, a green square appears in the calendar instead of gray, the more the additions, the more saturated the color. <I> My githab as of 04/09/2017 </ i> <a href = "https://github.com/ IgorKonovalov "> <img src =" http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/igor_dlinni/10709889/7641/7641_900.png "alt =" "title =" "> </a> There is even such a flash mob - 100 days Of code. You write the code every day, 100 days in a row. I did not participate in it myself, but the thing is excellent. Commit to the github, do something every day, even if it only takes 15 minutes, but every day - and the result will not be long in coming. Regularity of action is the key to success. A good video on this topic is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM39qhXle4g" target="_blank"> 7 Habits of Highly Effective Artists </a>. The second moment regarding actions is action with the mind . This is a complex moment and you can not write about it so simply. In general, the point is to look for your weaknesses and cover them - in the future they will slow you down, use the right literature, language, etc. Here everything is very individual. In a question with JS, you need to constantly keep your hand on the pulse of technology - and then start to study some kind of jQuery, and they are already except as in Russia and no one uses it, waste time. To start learning the technology you need from the foundations, to lay the foundation for the right understanding right away - it's like a solfeggio for music, like it's not necessary, but without it you can not become a professional. Also, the basis for programmers is English - without a good skill at least reading it is unlikely you can move far. In general, be critical of what you do and what you are advised to do, and skip everything through a kind of filter. Discarding unnecessary information can now even be more useful than finding it. It will be very useful to find people who are already working in the sphere and ask their advice (treat it still as critically). From here you can go to the third stage - <b> hunting </ b>. I did not just call it a hunt - variations with a predator sitting in an ambush seem to me the closest metaphor. The predator is sitting in ambush, he tries to change the smell and approach the victim from the leeward side. He calmly waits for the victim to jump to his feet, without worrying about what is happening and not thinking too much. Now decipher what I mean. <I> Kitten hunts </ i> <img src = "http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/igor_dlinni/10709889/7875/7875_900.png" alt = "" title = ""> Ambush are your actions. You seem to create around them a constant halo. People around you know what you do and what you do regularly. You seem to be sitting in the environment of your actions, not moving, not knocking down or stopping them. To change the smell is "work for the public" - as mentioned above, others should know what you are doing. Gradually, you will begin to appear small projects that can be shown - show them, listen to criticism, be <a href="https://twitter.com/igor_dlinni" target="_blank"> active in social networks </a>, < A href = "https://igorkonovalov.github.io/" target = "_ blank"> make yourself a website </a> - make sure that you are noticed. And they noticed neither as another slacker, but as a man of regular action. So you change the smell. Approach from the leeward side is also an action similar to the previous one - active selection to mining, for example, what is connected with the resume. Approach to writing it responsibly - on this account there are 1000000 tutorials on the network, and make it a dispatch of your habit. So you create all the necessary conditions, and you will sit in the ideal ambush. Will only wait. If you did everything right, your prey simply has no way to avoid being caught. Otherwise, it simply can not be. If this does not happen, reconsider your ambush. Maybe you need to change the angle of view, or smell. Cast away fear and uncertainty - this is the lot of herbivores. You're on the hunt. And when you see the victim - cling to it with a dead grip and do not let go, use all the possibilities, and if it breaks loose (I was not taken first by the company), keep quiet waiting, and be even more effective. <B> Start now </ b >, Believe in yourself, use the scientific method, and everything will turn out! Thank you for reading this long text! I hope, my example will inspire you! Many thanks to those people, without whom I could not do it. Immense gratitude and a deep bow: Anton Krotov, Vladimir Dolgachev, Alexandra Katushkova, Alice Konovalova, Angelina Sazhnova and Pavel Luzanov.
